# Mobile Development Environment Setup

## Objective
Mobile development demands more computational resources compared to web.  
We use **Expo Go** to test apps directly on devices without costly emulators.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js LTS
- VS Code
- macOS/Linux/Windows
- Expo Go (iOS/Android)

## Steps Taken
1. Installed Expo Go from:
   - [Google Play Store](https://expo.dev/go) (Android)
   - [Apple App Store](https://expo.dev/go) (iOS)
2. Logged into Expo account.
3. Verified Expo Go runs successfully on my device.

## Challenges & Notes
- QR code scan errors may occur if the camera permissions are not granted.
- Ensure that the device and the development machine are on the same network for proper connectivity.
- If login issues arise, check the Expo account credentials and internet connection.
