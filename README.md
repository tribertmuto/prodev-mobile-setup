# Mobile Development Environment Setup

## Objective
Mobile development requires more computational resources than web development. To streamline the process, we are using the **Expo Framework** for React Native. Expo simplifies development and allows testing directly on a physical device via the **Expo Go** app.

This README documents the setup process for installing and configuring **Expo Go**.

---

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js (LTS version)** → [Download Here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- **VS Code (Recommended IDE)** → [Download Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **Operating System**: macOS, Linux, or Windows
- **Physical Device**: Android or iOS smartphone

## Why Expo Go?
Traditionally, mobile app testing requires device emulators or simulators, which consume significant hardware resources.  
Expo Go solves this problem by allowing apps to be tested directly on your phone, making it lightweight, cost-effective, and cross-platform.
